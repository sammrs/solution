This module provides functions to calculate the time required to prepare and bake lasagna.
 
Functions included:
- bake_time_remaining: Calculates the remaining bake time.
- preparation_time_in_minutes: Calculates the preparation time based on the number of lasagna layers.
- elapsed_time_in_minutes: Calculates the total elapsed time including preparation and baking.
 
Constants:
- EXPECTED_BAKE_TIME: Default time required to bake lasagna.
- PREPARATION_TIME: Time needed to prepare each layer of lasagna.
